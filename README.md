# Band-Match: Bring bands and venues together!

## Purpose
This is a personal project that I am using to continue practicing the technical skills that I learnt during the DevAcademy bootcamp that I graduated from in October 2022.

It is a full stack app, built with Javascipt, using React/Redux and a sqlite database.

Will probably never be fully functional. Just a place for me to experiment and play!


## The idea
As a keen muso and I know that it can sometimes be hard for bands to find gigs.
Conversely, it can be hard for venues to find bands.

Band-Match has been conceived to solve these problems, by helping bands and venues find each other!

Currently it just runs locally, so it's purely hypothetical at this stage.  I'll look at deploying to a server eventually (maybe!)

## Steps to get Band-Match running:

* Clone the code to your local machine and open it in your chosen code editor
* Open your terminal and enter 'npm install'
* Enter 'npm run dev' in to your terminal
* Open your browser and enter [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) as the url

## Future enhancements / Backlog
* Add authentication/user account and logon functionality (e.g. Auth0)
* Deploy to a server (e.g. Heroku)
* Set-up and seed venues table
* Setup getVenues api and route and confirm using Insomnia
* Use getVenues api and route to render list of Venues
* Create AddVenue component, with form for adding details for new Venues
* Setup addVenues api and route and confirm using Insomnia
* New band is rendered along with existing Venues
* Setup deleteVenues api and route and confirm using Insomnia
* Design and implement a Navbar
